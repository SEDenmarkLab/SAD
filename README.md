# Sharpless Asymmetric Dihydroxylation (SAD) Modeling Codebase

This repository acts as documentation for code applied for Literature Scraping, Descriptor Calculation, and Modeling of the Sharpless Asymmetric Database written by Blake Ocampo. 

This utilizes 4 python packages:

* Molli 0.2 developed by Alex Shved for easy maintenance of 3D coordinates with personal modifications for High-Throughput DFT Calculations
* Radial Distribution Function developed by Nicholas "Ian" Rinehart with personal modifications for alkene carbon RDF descriptor calculations.
* Kneed Algorithm for Elbow Detection in Distortion Analysis (https://github.com/arvkevi/kneed)
* E3FP Fingerprinting Method for Experimental Alkene Structural Similarity Evaluation (J. Med. Chem. 2017, 60, 7393â€“7409)

The current iteration of code is reproducible through the modeling stage and is accurate for results through 5/3/23.
