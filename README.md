# Sharpless Asymmetric Dihydroxylation (SAD) Modeling Codebase
This repository acts as serialization of the code applied for Literature Scraping, Descriptor Calculation, and Modeling of the Sharpless Asymmetric Database.
All code was written and rerun by Blake Ocampo and is accurate as of 7/29/2025.

- The full database and tools for parsing can be found [here](https://github.com/SEDenmarkLab/SAD/tree/main/db_tools)

- All the associated modeling outputs and unsupervised analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/SEDenmarkLab/SAD/tree/main/modeling)

- The workflow for all specialized descriptor calculation from the database can be found [here](https://github.com/SEDenmarkLab/SAD/tree/main/descriptor_workflow)

- A simple workflow for measuring the similarity within the database of SMILES strings has also been created and can be found [here](https://github.com/SEDenmarkLab/SAD/blob/main/db_tools/Find_Similar_Molecules_in_DB.ipynb)
